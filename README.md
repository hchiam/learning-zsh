# Learning Zsh

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Slightly better [`bash`](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-bash-scripts). 

Switching from bash to zsh on Mac:

```bash
`chsh -s /bin/zsh`
```

`~/.zshenv` is zsh's version of bash's `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo source ~/.bash_profile > ~/.zshenv && source ~/.zshenv
```

Setting up zsh to use fish autosuggestion + syntax highlighting:

5 startup files that zsh reads commands from: 

http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html 

```
$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
```
